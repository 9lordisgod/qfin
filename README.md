## Statistics

Linear regression is the most heavily tested topic in statistics. Unfortunately, there is not single book that summarises all need-to-know knowledge. Greene's [Econometric Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386) * might be an overshoot due to its length.

[Analysis of Financial Time Series](http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Financial-Time-Series-Ruey/dp/0470414359) * I personally like other books more, but this book expose one to the most number of time series models.

[Time Series Analysis](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5386.html) A much better book, also more expensive.

## C/C++

## R

There's no real good book for R. Hadley's [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) is an excellent book, but it is only for advanced users.

Just read [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) from www.r-project.org and get yourself familar with the following packages:

- data.table
- dplyr
- foreach
- ggplot2
- reshape2

and these packages as well:

- stringr
- lubridate

Be sure to familarize yourself with the usage and output of these functions: `lm`, `glm`, `anova`, `summary.lm`, `plot.lm`.
